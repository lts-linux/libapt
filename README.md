# libapt

Libapt is a pure Rust apt library.

You can find the sources at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/tomirgang/libapt).

## Usage

TODO: describe

## Examples

Libapt provides some example applications.
You can run the examples using the command `cargo run --example NAME`,
where name is the name of the example.

### Test the examples

Some of the example tests are black box tests and depend on the binaries to exist.
Run `cargo build --examples` before `cargo test --examples`, else these tests will fail.
